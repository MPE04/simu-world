# Development steps


## Step 1 : initialisation


- [x] Create a first location
- [x] Create PNJ agent
- [x] PNJ comportment :
  - [x] All consume food at each step
  - [x] Some are producer and produce food
- [x] Run world
- [x] City food graph
- [x] Graph with Solara


## Step 1.1 : Consolidation

- [ ] PNJ role without production (management…)
- [ ] Add PNJ Happiness
- [ ] Add according graphs


## Step 4 : Second location and commerce


- [ ] Create a second location
