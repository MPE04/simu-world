# Simu-world: engine for dynamic virtual world

NOTE : is project is created by a newbee : I don’t have a real idea of the final step and all the roadmap, its mostly a hobbie when I have time.

## Goal

Simu-world goal is to generate a virtual world populated by PNJ with IA algorythm enough strong to modify the world.

The final world is not clearly describe yet (fantaisy, realist, SF…).

The final goal is to use this engine for video game by “scenes” : a town, a space part etc… The world will continue to live during the time the player is in the scene.


## Technics

First, it’s a python prototype developped MESA to use the agent-baed model. The goal is to easily develop and test the world, without regard to performance.

When the prototype will have a good maturity, the project will be re-written in a more efficient language to manage more agent. Final langauage choosen is JAVA + MASON due to personnal knowledge.

## Execute code
